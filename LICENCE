=======

As long as this project has be done to learn and check if it was possible to apply good practice everywhere,
this framework had no ambition.
Anyway, I wish that passioned people find this framework good and maybe help because like me they have not been satisfied by
some logic, practice problem in other famous framework.

If people want to contribute to this project, I will put the New BSD Licence (if contributors are agreeing)
but for now, the licence of Incube Framework is GPLv3.0 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)
